# Rock Paper Scissors

A silly little rock paper scissors game.

## Overview

I created this repository a while ago, and then I never did anything with it.
I'm in my C phase right now and when I found this while scrolling through my
GitHub, I knew I just had to do something with it.

## Rules

I'm sure most know the rules of Rock Paper Scissors, but just in case you
don't, here's how it works:

First, you pick a move out of either rock, paper, or scissors. Note that the
game will only accept the strings `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` verbatim as
input. That means that inputting the string `Rock` will cause an error.

After you pick your move, the computer player will pick its move. Then, the
winner will be determined based on the rule that rock beats scissors, scissors
beat paper, and paper beats rock. I suppose the reasoning is that rock squishes
scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock? Some of those don't make a
whole ton of sense, but I digress.
